<h2 id="setup-instructions">1.üîß Setup Instructions </h2>

   Currently we require Node version 16 or higher and NPM for our package manager.  Most places recommend using a node version manager to install node and npm. To proceed using NVM perform the following.. 

1. Clone the git repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git
   ```
2. Download NVM for your system. Find instructions here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
3. Install node version 16: 
   ```
   nvm install 16
   ```
4. Use that node version: 
   ```
   nvm use 16
   ```
5. Check that node and npm are set up:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   If either of those commands error, node has not been installed correctly.

6. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
7. Run the project: 
   ```
      npm run dev
   ```
8. PASS should launch at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now visit that url, and sign into a pod hosted at the OIDC provider of your choice.

<h2 id="project-overview">2. üöß Project Overview </h2>


In Portland, housing insecure individuals struggle to maintain documents often required to receive government and/or non-profit services. With PASS, we are building out an application to enable housing insecure individuals to store their personal documents in decentralized data stores, called Pods. Pass will also provide a platform for Organizations to assist with providing and processing documents required for housing assistance. Using [Solid Data Pods](https://solidproject.org/) individuals will have control over which organizations and applications can access their data. Verified organizations will be able to use PASS to request data from an individual and/or add documents (such as references or invoices) to an individuals pod to help process housing assistance applications.

<h2 id="terminology">üó£Ô∏è Terminology</h2>

- Individual/Client - housing insecure person using services to interact with organizations.
- Organization - housing agencies, landlords, government agencies that will be requesting information from individuals.
- Pod/Wallet - decentralized data/document storage built with Solid API. Individuals and organizations will have certain functionality within their pods.
- Folder/Container - referring to the URI location of document data in ttl files using Solid API with Inrupt library.
- ACL - Access Control List is used to manage Solid Pods by allowing users to control who can access and modify their data.

<h2 id="user-flows">üîÄ User Flows</h2>


1. Individual/Client
   - Upload and Maintain Documents
   - Able to share documents
   - Can copy verified documents into pod from organization(s)
   - Messaging to organizations
2. Organization
   - Can request and review documents
   - Can create verified documents
   - Can place files into clients pod with permission
   - Able to share verified documents with clients
