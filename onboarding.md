# Welcome to PASS!

## Project summary

Building out a decentralized application to enable houseless individuals to securely store their documents electronically. Verified organizations seeking documentation from individuals will utilize PASS to request and review documents from individuals, as well as share documents with individuals. Individuals will need to grant permission to organizations before they can access documents.

## Get started

1. Join [Code for PDX Slack](http://www.codeforpdx.org/welcome). If you run into any issues, shoot an email to our CodeForPDX brigade leader, Hugh: Hugh@codeforpdx.org
2. Post your email and GitHub name on the **#pass** channel and we‚Äôll add you to our [GitHub](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zTEd34K7Eg7rvg71zS6Uzbwrsct2Lx9E?ths=true).
3. Our project is currently broken into three teams: UX/UI, Project Management, and Developers (back and front end). We are currently meeting in separate groups based on team member availability. We come together as a team about one or twice a month.
4. Reach out to Flo (Project Manager) on slack to introduce yourself and share what team you wish to join.

## Ready to contribute?

1. We are still building out the bones of the project. The best way to get started is to follow the steps above and join a meeting to connect with those on the team.
2. Read the documentation in our GitHub ReadMe to become familiar with the technology we are with.
3. Feel free to check out/clone the various branches and play around with our use cases. Each should have documentation to follow.


## Our development process

1. [Create a new GitHub branch.](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS)
2. Build your feature.
3. Make a pull request. Request reviews from members of the team; you‚Äôll need their approval to merge.

- Good people to ask for reviews:
  - Frontend -- Jared, Flo, Kevin
  - Backend -- Kevin, Jared
  - Documentation -- Danica, Flo
  - UI/UX -- Gabby, Kyle
- When in doubt, ask more people for reviews!
- Include screenshots whenever you‚Äôre building a frontend feature.
